## What you'll do

Draw against a consultant's model (the structure, the services, the existing building) without copying anything into your own file.

A **linked model** is shown in the 3D view and cut on your plans, but it is never changed and never saved into your model. Your model keeps only the link: the file's name and where it goes.

## Link a model

1. In the left panel's {{ui:Linked models}} section, click {{ui:Link a model…}} and choose the IFC file. It shows at once, and its row says **Shown**.
2. Choose where it goes in {{ui:Placement}}:
   - **Shared coordinates** (to start): its coordinates are yours, as when both models were set out from the same origin.
   - **Map coordinates**: both files' map coordinates line them up (both need a map conversion; BimCraft says so when one has none).
   - **By two points…**: click a point on the linked model, then where it goes in yours; then a second pair. The link is moved and turned (about the vertical) to fit.
3. Each link and placement change is one step: {{key:Mod+Z}} takes it back.

## Work with it

- The plans show the linked model cut at the level's cut height as thin lines, and the {{ui:Wall}} tool and the other drawing tools snap to its corners and edges.
- Pick its elements in the 3D view to read their properties; a linked model is never the one you edit, so its radio button in {{ui:Models}} is off.
- **The file changed?** When the browser can watch the file (a file opened through its file picker, or in Studio), BimCraft reloads the link by itself a few seconds after the file is saved again, and says so. Otherwise click {{ui:Reload}}.
- {{ui:Unload}} hides it and frees the memory; the link stays in your model. {{ui:Load…}} shows it again (you choose the file: a browser cannot open a file by its name on its own).
- The × removes the link from your model.

## What you should see

- In your IFC file: an IfcDocumentReference for each link (the file's name), related to the project, and where it goes in the project's property set CadCraft_Links. Opening your model again lists its links as **Not loaded** until you load them.

:::note
Clash checks, Compare and Find can use a loaded link like any other open model: see [See several IFC models together](topic:several-models).
